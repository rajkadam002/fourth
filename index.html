            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
                belonging to diverse fields.[3][4][5] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at
                achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[6] But they often include other aims
                as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[6][3][7] However, there are deep disagreements
                about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some
                conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and
                learning.[8][9][4] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about
                by this process. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and
                dispositions that are characteristic of them.[8][9][4] However, the term may also refer to the academic
                study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as well as the social
                institutions involved in these processes.[9] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the
                Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is
                related to the homonym ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of")
                and dūcō ("I lead, I conduct").[10]

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
                informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually
                structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
                regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
                such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
                alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a
                more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
                settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a
                formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether
                unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly
                informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can
                be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.

                Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety
                of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>
